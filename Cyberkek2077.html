	 <h2 id="Gangs">Gangs in Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
	 <dl>
  <dt><strong>6th Street</strong></dt>
    <dd>After the 4th Corporate War, a large number of career soldiers were left without jobs or prospects - the most enterprising of them formed the 6th Street Gang.<br> Not only do they boast veterans among their ranks, but also ex-police officers,<br> former corporate security agents and "civilians" who have had a crash course in combat training - everyone and anyone who wants to bring order to this town.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Aldecaldos</strong></dt>
    <dd>One of the oldest nomad nations founded by Juan Aldecaldo, who fought a ruthless war at the tail-end of the 1990's against the gangs ruling LA.<br> He formed the "Neighborhood Watch," which numbered five thousand people by the time it left the city and was known for its emphasis on family values,<br> in whose name Juan launched his uprising against ineffective police and corrupt media.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Animals</strong></dt>
    <dd>The concrete jungle – for the Animals, it's not just a pretentious metaphor.<br> From their hormone-pumping, beast-inducing implants to their love of street combat, the Animals are obsessed with the wild side of human nature.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Maelstrom</strong></dt>
    <dd>A gang that controls the districts of Watson and the Northside Industrial District (NID).<br> You can easily recognize them by their intimidating faceplates and hostile optic implants,<br> which not only indicates their gang affiliation but also their fetishization of cyberware and cybermodification.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Moxes</strong></dt>
    <dd>The youngest established gang in Night City. Its beginnings date back to 2067 when the murder of a sex worker sparked riots that lasted days.<br> The gang formed out of the protesters attracted many others to its ranks for years after. 
The Mox is a motley crew of current and former sex workers, punks, freaks and all kinds of outcasts.<br> The gang's main headquarters is Lizzie's Bar, a braindance club that serves as the Mox's main source of income.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Tyger Claws</strong></dt>
    <dd>Night City is a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, though when it comes to its Asian demographic, the Chinese and Japanese influence is unmistakable – as are the Tyger Claws.<br> As a gang the Tyger Claws are well-organized, efficient and savvy – but also unpredictable.<br> Their business decisions are purely rational, but when it comes to their enemies or a disloyal gang member, their methods can be shocking.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Valentinos</strong></dt>
	<dd>Loud vests, flashy gold cyberware, heavy jewellery, tattoos of Santa Muerte and Jesus Malaverde – you'd have a hard time mistaking a Valentino when you saw one.<br> Inspired by Chicano culture, their expressive style makes them seem like something straight out of a Mexican barrio.<br> But if you look closer, you'll see anyone can join the gang, no matter their background or ethnicity.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Voodoo Boys</strong></li>
	<dd>A mysterious gang of netrunners based in Pacifica. The Voodoo Boys uphold the district's independence and act as the leaders of the area's predominantly Haitian community.<br> Ominous rumors circulate about the gang – those who know the most about them are netrunners from Night City (at the very least they can recognize a Voodoo Boys virus when it hits their system)<br> and NetWatch agents, who for years have been trying to eliminate them – unsuccessfully, of course.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Wraiths</strong></dt>
  <dd>The first and new nomad codes elaborate the various reasons you might be expelled from your family, including "Share with others in your clan" or "Do not keep for yourself that which may help another in your clan."<br> Reading those documents today, it's hard to fight the feeling they were written in different, happier times.<br> These days, nomads are more often expelled from their families for murdering or raping a fellow family member, human trafficking, poisoning the water supply or betrayal of the clan. And we have a word for those nomads: the Raffen Shiv.</dd>
